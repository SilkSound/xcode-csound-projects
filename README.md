# xcode-csound-projects

I am a dedicated CSound user. Creating all sorts of wonderful sounds for my own projects and soundscapes.
All is great, except for some annoying aspects of working in an API with only text as you're expression tool.

The instrument definition part is not a major problem. An instrument may be complex, but it 'just' a bit of coding. So I'm going to do nothing
with that part of the CSound project file (.csd).

With a multitude of GEN-routines, each with it's specific variable list(s), it is sometimes frustrating to initialize them.
Lots of numbers, seperated by a space and the inability to look at what you're doing graphically is not the most encouraging way of being creative.
The same counbts for the actual score part of the .csd file. It's OK if you're just using a small amount of notes, with a reduced number of P-fields.
Creating hundreds of note score objects, with extensive use of P-fields requires a lot of typing.

As a personal project I've started a XCode project, using Swift 5.... to make a graphical environment for creating function definitions and for
different ways to create note objects, either by drawing out shapes, or by calculation, or by whatever means.

Why not use MAX MSP? This is a rectified question, because it's a great shell around the CSound-core.
Three reasons: It doesn't exactly do what I want it to do
               While working on this it stimulates me to be more creative and come up with more uses of what I'm intending
               I'm stubborn and want to do several things MY way.
               
 Will I ever be able to make use of what I'm cooking up? I don't know. I sincerely hope so. It all depends on how fast I develop as a
 Swift/Mac programmer and evenly important is how much can I restrict myself.
 For now I have I reasonable understanding of the MAC OS architecture, I have a reasonable understanding of Swift, NOT unlimited amounts of time,
 but a real good motivation.
